# CryptoClustering

Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention in recent years due to their volatile nature and potential for substantial price changes within short time frames. Understanding the factors influencing these price changes is crucial for investors and traders. This project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms such as K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
